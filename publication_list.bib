	abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements have been linked to perception by a common attentional mechanism. We investigated whether perceptual performance was traded for smooth pursuit performance. While tracking a red target cross, observers had to discriminate the orientation of a ﬂashed peripheral grating. We manipulated the priority given to the two tasks. Pursuit gain changed according to observers’ effort to pursue the target, but perceptual discrimination of the peripheral ﬂash was not affected by these changes, suggesting that smooth pursuit does not use the same resources as perception. Complete resource sharing may be conﬁned to situations involving multiple moving objects. Next, we added a second perceptual task on the foveal pursuit target. Foveal discrimination performance was traded for peripheral discrimination performance and pursuit gain followed the perceptual priorities. Thus, smooth pursuit gain is affected by which target has been selected for enhanced perceptual processing, but that does not imply shared perceptual resources.},

	abstract = {It is known that visual transients prolong saccadic latency and reduce saccadic frequency. The latter effect was attributed to subcortical structures because it occurred only 60–70 ms after stimulus onset. We examined the effects of large task-irrelevant transients on steady-state pursuit and the generation of catch-up saccades. Two screen-wide stripes of equal contrast (4, 20, or 100\%) were briefly flashed at equal eccentricities (3, 6, or 12°) from the pursuit target. About 100 ms after flash onset, we observed that pursuit gain dropped by 6–12\% and catch-up saccades were entirely suppressed. The relatively long latency of the inhibition suggests that it results from cortical mechanisms that may act by promoting fixation or the deployment of attention over the visual field. In addition, we show that a loud irrelevant sound is able to generate the same inhibition of saccades as visual transients, whereas it only induces a weak modulation of pursuit gain, indicating a privileged access of acoustic information to the saccadic system. Finally, irrelevant changes in motion direction orthogonal to pursuit had a smaller and later inhibitory effect.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have suggested that the deployment of attention is linked to saliency. In contrast, very little is known about how salient objects are perceived. To probe the perception of salient elements, observers compared two horizontally aligned stimuli in an array of eight elements. One of them was salient because of its orientation or direction of motion. We observed that the perceived luminance contrast or color saturation of the salient element increased: the salient stimulus looked even more salient. We explored the possibility that changes in appearance were caused by attention. We chose an event-related potential indexing attentional selection, the N2pc, to answer this question. The absence of an N2pc to the salient object provides preliminary evidence against involuntary attentional capture by the salient element. We suggest that signals from a master saliency map flow back into individual feature maps. These signals boost the perceived feature contrast of salient objects, even on perceptual dimensions different from the one that initially defined saliency.},

It has been suggested that poor attentional selection of the pursuit target was responsible for reductions of pursuit gain. To quantify the detrimental eﬀects of attention, we instructed observers to either pay attention to background objects or to ignore them. The to-be-attended object was indicated by peripheral or central cues. Strong reductions of pursuit gain occurred when the following conditions were met: (a) the subject payed attention to the object (b) a salient event was present, for instance the onset of the target or cue and (c) the attended target produced retinal motion. Removing any of the three conditions resulted in no or far smaller decreases of pursuit gain. Further, decreases in pursuit gain were present with perceptual discrimination and simple manual detection.},

Carrasco, 2005), our results showed that non-informative peripheral cues do not improve perceptual performance at the cued location. However, informative peripheral or central cues improved perceptual performance. When we changed the task from an unspeeded perceptual task to a speeded reaction time task, the absence of involuntary cueing effects persisted when a distractor was presented. Without distractors, involuntary cueing effects re-emerged. When target contrast was increased, involuntary cueing effects re-emerged with a distractor but were smaller than without. We suggest that more difﬁcult perceptual tasks reduce or abolish involuntary cueing effects.},

	abstract = {During smooth pursuit eye movements, the visual system is faced with the task of telling apart reafferent retinal motion from motion in the world. While an efference copy signal can be used to predict the amount of reafference to subtract from the image, an image-based adaptive mechanism can ensure the continued accuracy of this computation. Indeed, repeatedly exposing observers to background motion with a fixed direction relative to that of the target that is pursued leads to a shift in their point of subjective stationarity (PSS). We asked whether the effect of exposure reflects adaptation to motion contingent on pursuit direction, recalibration of a reference signal or both. A recalibration account predicts a shift in reference signal (i.e. predicted reafference), resulting in a shift of PSS, but no change in sensitivity. Results show that both directional judgements and confidence judgements about them favor a recalibration account, whereby there is an adaptive shift in the reference signal caused by the prevailing retinal motion during pursuit. We also found that the recalibration effect is specific to the exposed visual hemifield.},

	abstract = {Involuntary ocular tracking responses to background motion offer a window on the dynamics of motion computations. In contrast to spatial attention, we know little about the role of feature-based attention in determining this ocular response. To probe feature-based effects of background motion on involuntary eye movements, we presented human observers with a balanced background perturbation. Two clouds of dots moved in opposite vertical directions while observers tracked a target moving in horizontal direction. Additionally, they had to discriminate a change in the direction of motion (±10° from vertical) of one of the clouds. A vertical ocular following response occurred in response to the motion of the attended cloud. When motion selection was based on motion direction and color of the dots, the peak velocity of the tracking response was 30\% of the tracking response elicited in a single task with only one direction of background motion. In two other experiments, we tested the effect of the perturbation when motion selection was based on color, by having motion direction vary unpredictably, or on motion direction alone. Although the gain of pursuit in the horizontal direction was significantly reduced in all experiments, indicating a trade-off between perceptual and oculomotor tasks, ocular responses to perturbations were only observed when selection was based on both motion direction and color. It appears that selection by motion direction can only be effective for driving ocular tracking when the relevant elements can be segregated before motion onset.},

	abstract = {People’s eyes are directed at objects of interest with the aim of acquiring visual information. However, processing this information is constrained in capacity, requiring task-driven and salience-driven attentional mechanisms to select few among the many available objects. A wealth of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence has demonstrated that visual selection and the motor selection of saccade targets rely on shared mechanisms. This coupling supports the premotor theory of visual attention put forth more than 30 years ago, postulating visual selection as a necessary stage in motor selection. In this review, we examine to which extent the coupling of visual and motor selection observed with saccades is replicated during ocular tracking. Ocular tracking combines catch-up saccades and smooth pursuit to foveate a moving object. We ﬁnd evidence that ocular tracking requires visual selection of the speed and direction of the moving target, but the position of the motion signal may not coincide with the position of the pursuit target. Further, visual and motor selection can be spatially decoupled when pursuit is initiated (open-loop pursuit). We propose that a main function of coupled visual and motor selection is to serve the coordination of catch-up saccades and pursuit eye movements. A simple race-to-threshold model is proposed to explain the variable coupling of visual selection during pursuit, catch-up and regular saccades, while generating testable predictions. We discuss pending issues, such as disentangling visual selection from preattentive visual processing and response selection, and the pinpointing of visual selection mechanisms, which have begun to be addressed in the neurophysiological literature.},

In many applications, the user needs to look at symbols on a virtual on-screen keyboard and maintain gaze to make a selection. Executive control is essential to learning to use gaze-control, affecting the uptake of the technology. Specifically, the user of a gaze-controlled interface must suppress looking for its own sake, the so-called “Midas touch” problem. In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/2mak4), we tested whether gaze-typing performance depends on executive control and whether learning-dependent plasticity leads to improved executive control as measured using the antisaccade task. Forty-two university students were recruited as participants. After five 30-min training sessions, we found shorter antisaccade latencies in a gaze-control compared to a mouse-control group, and similar error-rates. Subjective workload ratings were also similar across groups, indicating the task in both groups was matched for difficulty. These findings suggest that executive control contributes to gaze-typing performance and leads to learning-induced plasticity.},

Prior knowledge of Newtonian physics may play a role in disambiguating an object’s movement as well as foveation by increasing the spatial resolution of the visual input. Observers were shown a virtual 3D scene, representing an ambiguously rotating ball translating on the ground. The ball was perceived as rotating congruently with friction, but only when gaze was located at the point of contact. Inverting or even removing the visual context had little influence on congruent judgements compared with the effect of gaze. Counterintuitively, gaze at the point of contact determines the solution of perceptual ambiguity, but independently of visual context. We suggest this constitutes a frugal strategy, by which the brain infers dynamics locally when faced with a foveated input that is ambiguous.},

Bauer, Cheadle, Parton, Müller, and Usher reported that attention can also be captured by a stimulus that flickers subliminally at 50 Hz, presumably by entrainment of neurons to the flicker frequency. In their reaction time (RT) task, participants had to locate a subtle change in the spatial frequency content of one of three Gabors (the target). Prior to target onset, presumably subliminal 50-Hz flicker in one of the Gabors served as a spatial cue. Bauer et al. found faster RTs when the cued location was congruent with the target location than when the cue was incongruent with the target location. In their experiments, the cue stopped to flicker at 50 Hz at target onset and was replaced by a stimulus flickering at 100 Hz (i.e., the screen refresh rate). In the present study, we show that the transition from 50 to 100 Hz results in a flash-like impression that can be localized above chance. We suggest that the illusory transition flash interfered with the localization of the subtle target, which contributed to the congruency effect. In support of this view, participants selected the flickering object more often than the non-flickering object when they failed to respond to the target. Further, no cueing effects were observed when the cue continued to flicker until the end of the trial or when the target was a salient change in polarity. In our view, the cueing effect occurs because observers confuse the illusory transition flash with the target when the two are similar. When truly subliminal flicker is used (70-Hz flicker), very small cueing effects persist in the absence of an illusory transition flash but may be accounted for by small effects on reaction time unrelated to attention.},

	abstract = {Long-range apparent motion is the illusory motion that can be perceived when two static and distant stimuli are presented in succession. Within some spatiotemporal range not only is motion sensed, but it appears as if one stimulus is displaced from one place to another (termed beta or optimal motion). Several groups have found that this illusory percept can interact with perception of a physically present stimulus, but some disagree on the origin of these interactions. We know little about how suppressive effects depend on feature-similarity between a target and the stimuli in apparent motion (inducers)—which would indicate an early perceptual locus—or even about the minimal conditions under which to obtain this effect. Unlike early studies that used a two-stroke apparent motion paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that motion can mask stimuli presented at interpolated locations along the apparent motion path, as shown by the elevation of contrast thresholds compared to a control condition. Apparent motion masking depended on color similarity between target and inducers. Further, we found evidence that the color of inducers alters the apparent color of intervening gray probes, indicating some inheritance or chromatic averaging across distant locations, but no clear evidence of predictive updating. Finally, the analysis of the presentation times delivering maximal masking effects suggests a predictive interpolation process is responsible for interference by apparent motion filling-in. We discuss alternative mechanisms, in particular the possible role of apparent-motion-induced metacontrast masking in generating this pattern of results.},

	abstract = {Many studies indicate that saccades are necessarily preceded by a shift of attention to the target location. There is no direct evidence for the same coupling during smooth pursuit. If smooth pursuit and attention were coupled, pursuit onset should be delayed whenever attention is focused on a stationary, non-target location. To test this hypothesis, observers were instructed to shift their attention to a peripheral location according to a location cue (Experiments 1 and 2) or a symbolic cue (Experiment 3) around the time of smooth pursuit initiation. Attending to static targets had only negligible effects on smooth pursuit latencies and the early open-loop response but lowered pursuit velocity substantially about the onset of closed-loop pursuit. Around this time, eye velocity reﬂected the competition between the to-be-tracked and to-be-attended object motion, entailing a reduction of eye velocity by 50\% compared to the single task condition. The precise time course of attentional modulation of smooth pursuit initiation was at odds with the idea that an attention shift must precede any voluntary eye movement. Finally, the initial catch-up saccades were strongly delayed with attention diverted from the pursuit target. Implications for models of target selection for pursuit and saccades are discussed.},

	abstract = {Peripheral cues induce facilitation with short cue-target intervals and inhibition of return (IOR) with long cue-target intervals. Modulations of facilitation and IOR by continuous displacements of the eye or the cued stimuli are poorly understood. Previously, the retinal coordinates of the cued location were changed by saccadic or smooth pursuit eye movements during the cue-target interval. In contrast, we probed the relevant coordinates for facilitation and IOR by orthogonally varying object motion (stationary, moving) and eye movement (Wxation, smooth pursuit). In the pursuit conditions, cue and target were presented during the ongoing eye movement and observers made a saccade to the target. Importantly, we found facilitation and IOR of similar size during smooth pursuit and Wxation. The results suggest that involuntary orienting is possible even when attention has to be allocated to the moving target during smooth pursuit. Comparison of conditions with stabilized and moving objects suggest an oculocentric basis for facilitation as well as inhibition. Facilitation and IOR were reduced with objects that moved on the retina both with smooth pursuit and eye Wxation.},

	abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are strongly inﬂuenced by shifts of attention to non-target objects. In contrast, we have shown previously that the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements is relatively unaffected when attention is shifted to objects that are either stationary or move in the same direction as the pursuit target (Souto \& Kerzel, 2008). Here, we asked how attention interacts with target selection when a choice has to be made between objects moving in opposite directions. In a dual-task paradigm, observers had to pursue a designated object while making a perceptual judgment on an object moving in the opposite direction. The perceptual target was brieﬂy presented after motion onset and disappeared before the eye started to move. The priority assigned to the perceptual and pursuit task was varied. When priority of the perceptual task was equal or greater than priority of the pursuit task, observers frequently pursued the wrong target and pursuit was delayed. We conclude that when an oculomotor choice is to be made between two equally salient motion signals, the successful initiation of pursuit eye movements depends on the presence of an attentional bias towards the target location.},
